# Custom folder

Here you can create a CMakeLists.txt file where to add your custom scripts
They will be git-ignored 

Remember to use cmake macro inside your CMakeLists.txt to correctly 
add scripts to project solution.

BTW, **We strongly suggest you** to use our module system to create your custom 
powerful module instead of simple scripts.
