I take no ownership of any of this code.  It all belongs to AzerothCore peeps, i'm just trying to get bots working and sharing what I have in hopes some other people will give it a boost.  Only reason why I want to get bots working is because i'm on a very limited internet connection and it's pretty boring playing by myself on a lone server.  I just hope someone will help me with this and give it the proper boost it needs.  

The version here will run, aiplayerbot.conf needs to be in the bin directory, It seg faults more the more bots is loaded.  I think it has something to do with RAM and CPU, as my devel box is not very powerful.  That's going to change once I find some more DDR3 ram.  But for now, any help with this side project would be helpful.  If you'd like to help, i can make you an editor on this and I'll help what I can.

## Introduction

AzerothCore is an open source game-server application for World of Warcraft, currently supporting the 3.3.5a game version.

It is written in C++ and based on MaNGOS, TrinityCore and SunwellCore.

## Why AzerothCore?

Our main goal is to create a playable game server, offering a fully working game experience. In short, we focus on the **user experience (UX)**.

We also believe in [software modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), because the more the software is modular, and the more it will be easy to be maintained, understood, developed, etc... So we organized the structure of AzerothCore as modular as possible, giving the possibility to [create new modules](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/wiki/Create-a-Module) to add custom features (instead of patching the core).

## Learning project

AzerothCore is a learning project.
